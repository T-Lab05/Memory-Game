# Memory-Game
  This is the project in Front End Nanodegree of Udacity to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  There are 16 cards arranged randomly on the deck. You need to open two cards with the same symbols. You memorize cards you have already opened to decrease the number of trials in a shorter span.
  
# How to star the game
